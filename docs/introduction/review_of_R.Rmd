A review of R
======

To develop advanced classifiers in R, an obvious prerequisite is some familiarity with R's basic
features:

* Manipulating `list`s and `data.frame`s (including subsetting and column manipulation)
* Understanding the `apply` family of functions (`apply`, `lapply`, `sapply`, and maybe `tapply` and `vapply`)
* The basics of functional programming, including functions that produce other functions
* A grasp of environments and R's use of the stack
* (Optional) A familiarity with R's OOP systems: S3, reference classes, and S4 (in descending order of importance)
* (Optional) The basics of package development

All of these topics and more are covered extensively in Hadley's
[Advanced R Development book](http://adv-r.had.co.nz). You should review at least the first five chapters,
and take the quiz in the following section to test your understanding. After you understand the answers to the quiz,
we can begin with the basics of processing data sets: the details of data preparation.
